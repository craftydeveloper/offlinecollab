# OfflineCollab

A local-first collaboration core with deterministic conflict resolution and offline-first synchronization.

## Why this project

OfflineCollab contains a deterministic last-writer-wins merge core with Lamport clocks, actor tie-breaking, and tombstones. The next layer can add transport and encrypted local persistence without changing conflict semantics.

## What is included

- A typed domain core with a project-specific algorithm.
- A small HTTP API for creating and listing local records.
- An in-memory repository interface that can be replaced by durable storage.
- Unit and HTTP tests, strict type checking, and continuous integration.
- Operational and architecture notes that call out the prototype boundaries.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev
```

The development server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Set `HOST` and `PORT` to change the local address. The record API is intended for development until authentication, durable storage, rate limits, and deployment controls are added.

## API

- `GET /healthz` returns service health.
- `GET /api/records` lists records in the in-memory store.
- `GET /api/records/:id` retrieves one record.
- `POST /api/records` validates and creates a record.

## Quality bar

Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before proposing a change. Keep domain logic deterministic, document data assumptions, and add regression tests for edge cases.
